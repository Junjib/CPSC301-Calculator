# Description

This Program is a calculator designed to calculate the sum or difference of long numbers. The numbers that this calculator finds the sum or difference of are too large to be stored into existing data types (long, double); therefore each number is stored into a linked list with each node of that list holding a single digit. The numbers as well as the desired operation is read from a text file and once the result is calculated it is then written to another text file. This process repeats until all values in the input file has been read and all results have been written to the output file. A sample input and output file has been provided.
